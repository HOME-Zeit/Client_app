<h1><b>To work with this project you have to:</b></h1>
1. Install latest [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (includes JavaFX 8).
2. Install Eclipse 4.3 or greater (<b>better</b> [Eclipse Luna](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)).
3. Install [e(fx)clipse plugin](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious).
4. Install the latest [SceneBuilder](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-info-2157684.html)

<h1><b>Also you have to configurate Eclipse:</b></h1>
1. Tell Eclipse to use JDK8 : Windows->Pref. ->Java -> installed JRE . There set jre/jdk 1.8.*
2. In Windows->Pref. ->Java -> Compiler . Set the Compiler compliance level to 1.8.
3. In Windows->Pref. ->JavaFX . Set path to your scenebuilder.exe .

<h1><b>Libs</b></h1>
I have used this libs:
1. [ControlsFX](http://fxexperience.com/controlsfx/). Here to download zip-file of [ControlsFX 8.20.8](http://fxexperience.com/downloads/controlsfx-8.20.8.zip).

<b>Actually<b>, you have to see it in /lib folder. But for sure add the library to your project's classpath: In Eclipse right-click on the jar file | Build Path | Add to Build Path. Now Eclipse knows about the library.
